    "# Introduction\n",
    "Tools like SHAP, LIME, and Partial Dependence Plot show which feature contribute more to the predicted outcome. Counterfactual works in the opposite direction i.e. which feature do we update in order to minimize the value of the preidicted outcome. \n",

    "Counterfactuals are also called contrastive explanations.\n",

    "# How it works\n",
    "In image classification, adding minimal noise to an image can change the prediction of an image from, let's say, a 'panda' to a 'gibbon'. Say, we are interested in identifying minimum change to the input image that changes the prediction from a panda to a gibbon. We can find that out by solving the following optimization problem, and this can work for any model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "argmin_{x'} \\quad d(x, x') \\quad s.t. \\quad f(x') = c\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $x$ is an observation from the dataset\n",
    "- $f(.)$ is the model\n",
    "- $x'$ is the perturbed observation\n",
    "- $d()$ is a distance function\n",
    "\n",
    "Counterfactuals can be implemented as both model-specific and model-agnostic; and there are several implemenations of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Features\n",
    "- Model agnostics\n",
    "- Algorithms like DiCE can generate both local and global counterfactual\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Challenges\n",
    "- The Rashomon effect i.e. multiple counterfactuals can lead to the same outcome, which makes is difficult to identify which action to take\n",
    "- Cognitively demanding for user to process the counterfactuals\n",
    "- Machine generated counterfactuals maybe too little or too few differences. This makes it more challenging to get meaning out of them. To mitigat this, some algorithms like DiCE have parameter to adjust the diversity of the counterfactuals. "
